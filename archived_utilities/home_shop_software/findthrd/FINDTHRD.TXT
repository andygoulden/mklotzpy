Andy Pugh, UK, has compiled a table of ~400 "standard" threads  arranged in
order of size (from 10 Whitworth instrument (0.010" dia.) up to 6" Gas)
identified by type.  A very handy tool for identifying 'mystery' threads one
might encounter - especially when dealing with British equipment.

The list is a bit tiresome to search by hand if one is trying to identify an
unknown thread.  I wrote a program to search it using either major diameter or
pitch as the search argument.
